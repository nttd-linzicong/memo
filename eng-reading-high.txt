Passage One (Clinton Is Right)
President Clinton’s decision on Apr.8 to send Chinese Premier Zhu Rongji packing without an agreement on China’s entry into the World Trade Organization seemed to be a massive miscalculation. The President took a drubbing from much of the press, which had breathlessly reported that a deal was in the bag. The Cabinet and Whit House still appeared divided, and business leaders were characterized as furious over the lost opportunity. Zhu charged that Clinton lacked “the courage” to reach an accord. And when Clinton later telephoned the angry Zhu to pledge a renewed effort at negotiations, the gesture was widely portrayed as a flip-flop.
In fact, Clinton made the right decision in holding out for a better WTO deal. A lot more horse trading is needed before a final agreement can be reached. And without the Administration’s goal of a “bullet-proof agreement” that business lobbyists can enthusiastically sell to a Republican Congress, the whole process will end up in partisan acrimony that could harm relations with China for years.
THE HARD PART. Many business lobbyists, while disappointed that the deal was not closed, agree that better terms can still be had. And Treasury Secretary Robert E. Rubin, National Economic Council Director Gene B. Sperling, Commerce Secretary William M. Daley, and top trade negotiator Charlene Barshefsky all advised Clinton that while the Chinese had made a remarkable number of concessions, “we’re not there yet,” according to senior officials.
Negotiating with Zhu over the remaining issues may be the easy part. Although Clinton can signal U.S. approval for China’s entry into the WTO himself, he needs Congress to grant Beijing permanent most-favored-nation status as part of a broad trade accord. And the temptation for meddling on Capital Hill may prove over-whelming. Zhu had barely landed before Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott (R-Miss) declared himself skeptical that China deserved entry into the WTO. And Senators Jesse A. Helms (R-N.C.) and Emest F. Hollings (D-S. C.) promised to introduce a bill requiring congressional approval of any deal.
The hidden message from these three textile-state Southerners: Get more protection for the U. S. clothing industry. Hoping to smooth the way, the Administration tried, but failed, to budge Zhu on textiles. Also left in the lurch: Wall Street, Hollywood, and Detroit. Zhu refused to open up much of the lucrative Chinese securities market and insisted on “cultural” restrictions on American movies and music. He also blocked efforts to allow U. S. auto makers to provide fleet financing.
BIG JOB. Already, business lobbyists are blanketing Capitol Hill to presale any eventual agreement, but what they’ve heard so far isn’t encouraging. Republicans, including Lott, say that “the time just isn’t right” for the deal. Translation: We’re determined to make it look as if Clinton has capitulated to the Chinese and is ignoring human, religious, and labor rights violations; the theft of nuclear-weapons technology; and the sale of missile parts to America’s enemies. Beijing’s fierce critics within the Democratic Party, such as Senator Paul D. Wellstone of Minnesota and House Minority leader Richard A. Gephardt of Missouri, won’t help, either.
Just how tough the lobbying job on Capitol Hill will be become clear on Apr. 20, when Rubin lectured 19chief executives on the need to discipline their Republican allies. With business and the White House still trading charges over who is responsible for the defeat of fast-track trade negotiating legislation in 1997, working together won’t be easy. And Republicans—with a wink—say that they’ll eventually embrace China’s entry into the WTO as a favor to Corporate America. Though not long before they torture Clinton. But Zhu is out on a limb, and if Congress overdoes the criticism, he may be forced by domestic critics to renege. Business must make this much dear to both its GOP allies and the Whit House: This historic deal is too important to risk losing to any more partisan squabbling

Translation.     翻譯。這是作者為共和黨的“The time isn’t right”做注解/解釋。

寫作方法與文章大意
   文章以先聲奪人的寫作手法：克林頓不同意中國加入世貿打發朱總理回國引出兩黨（共和黨和民主黨）矛盾，國會和白宮之相反意見（對比寫法）到最終四方趨向一致來證明總統決定是對的——以最好的價碼使美國獲得最佳利益為前提同意中國加入世貿來滿足美國商人的要求。

答案祥解
C. 總統是對的。這篇文章摘自Business Weekly. 文章是從商人的角度來看待中國加入WTO，他們希望從談判中獲得更多的利益，而克林頓的同意不同意的目的和他們相符——爭取更多利益。這篇就是從四方利益最終趨向一致“同意中國加入世貿”來證明“總統結論正確”的中心思想。
第一段指出Clinton由打發朱總理回國，不同意中國入世到一百八十度大轉彎，在電話中憤怒的朱總理表示再次努力協商。內閣和白宮官員意見分歧，商人對失去機會火冒三丈。
第二段點出克林頓故意拖延以謀取更多的利益的決定是正確的——文章的主旨句。商人院外活動集團成員要以“政府完美無缺的協定的目標來說服共和黨贊成/接受。以免整個過程以黨爭而告終。
第三，四段是商業方面的高級官員的代表紛紛卻說Clinton“當中國作出許多優惠讓步時，美國不在那裏。”（意：美國吃虧了現在不要再吃虧了。）克林頓有權簽署贊成中國加入世貿組織，可他需要國會批准北京永久性最惠國作為擴大貿易協定的組成部分。再說對國會的干預的誘惑力相當大：就在朱踏上美國本土時，參議院多數派領袖Trent Lott宣佈他對中國是該不該入世持懷疑態度，而參議院Tesse A Helms… 承諾提出一項要求國會批准任何交易的提案。
第五段講了朱總理的強硬立場。第六段又是共和黨的反對聲，使民主黨內站在北京以便的批評家也無能為力。
最後一段指出：儘管困難重重，這一歷史事件太重要了，不能因黨爭而冒失失去機會的危險。
A. 民主黨和共和黨的矛盾。兩党之爭見上文譯注，最終還是一致。      B. 論中國加入世貿組織。文章不是論中國加入而是論美國環繞中國入世貿的種種。       D. 商人院外活動集團成員控制國會。這在第五段中提到商人院外活動集團成員阻撓美國國會事先接受最終協定，但不是主題思想。
A. 朱總理拒絕了他們的要求。見難句譯注9。
B. 這三個地方批評過頭。      C. 他們要求更多的保護。        D. 他們陷入困境。
A. 矛盾。共和黨一開始就反對。什麼對中國該不該加入世貿組織持懷疑態度。第六段說得更露骨，時間不對。意思是他們想把整個事件看起來好象克林頓屈從於中國，忽視了“中國違反人權，宗教權，勞動權，偷竊核武器技術，把導彈組成部件買給美國的敵人”等事實。最後一段共和黨一下子又所他們最終將會接受中國加入世貿組織以表示對整體美國的好感。不管是商人院外活動集團的作用，還是明確指出重開談判的重要性。這一歷史事件太重要絕不能因黨爭而失去機會。共和黨縱然心中不願，也不得不接受現實。心情是矛盾的。
B. 讚賞。       C. 不贊成。         D. 厭惡。
D. 商界。第一段中就點出：商界領袖對失去這次機會火冒三丈。第二段中提到商界院外活動成員要以實實在在的協議來說服共和黨國會，免得以黨爭告終。第三段明確指出：許多商界院外人士一方面對協議未簽定表示失望，另方面又同意，還會更好的條件。各種和商界直接關係的高級官員對克林頓勸說。
第五段：紡織，金融股票，汽車以至電影等都是商界的要求。朱總理拒絕的就是商界要求。
第六段提及商界院外活動的成員制止國會事先接受最終協定。
最後一段又是商界使共和黨聯盟和白宮懂得此事的重要性。
A. 美國將會作出讓步，見上面注釋。商人是絕對不會放棄中國市場的。
B. 美國會故意拖延以求取得更好的條件。這一點恐怕不會，見上文注釋。朱總理的強硬立場，商人的見解。            C. 克林頓有簽署批准中國入世之權。        D. 民主黨贊成中國加入世貿，這兩項都是事實。

Passage Two (Europe’s Gypsies, Are They a Nation?)
The striving of countries in Central Europe to enter the European Union may offer an unprecedented chance to the continent’s Gypsies (or Roman) to be recognized as a nation, albeit one without a defined territory. And if they were to achieve that they might even seek some kind of formal place—at least a total population outnumbers that of many of the Union’s present and future countries. Some experts put the figure at 4m-plus; some proponents of Gypsy rights go as high as 15m.
Unlike Jews, Gypsies have had no known ancestral land to hark back to. Though their language is related to Hindi, their territorial origins are misty. Romanian peasants held them to be born on the moon. Other Europeans (wrongly) thought them migrant Egyptians, hence the derivative Gypsy. Most probably they were itinerant metal workers and entertainers who drifted west from India in the 7th century.
However, since communism in Central Europe collapsed a decade ago, the notion of Romanestan as a landless nation founded on Gypsy culture has gained ground. The International Romany Union, which says it stands for 10m Gypsies in more than 30 countries, is fostering the idea of “self-rallying”. It is trying to promote a standard and written form of the language; it waves a Gypsy flag (green with a wheel) when it lobbies in such places as the United Bations; and in July it held a congress in Prague, The Czech capital. Where President Vaclav Havel said that Gypsies in his own country and elsewhere should have a better deal.
At the congress a Slovak-born lawyer, Emil Scuka, was elected president of the International Tomany Union. Later this month a group of elected Gypsy politicians, including members of parliament, mayors and local councilors from all over Europe (OSCE), to discuss how to persuade more Gypsies to get involved in politics.
The International Romany Union is probably the most representative of the outfits that speak for Gypsies, but that is not saying a lot. Of the several hundred delegates who gathered at its congress, few were democratically elected; oddly, none came from Hungary, whose Gypsies are perhaps the world’s best organized, with some 450 Gypsy bodies advising local councils there. The union did, however, announce its ambition to set up a parliament, but how it would actually be elected was left undecided.
So far, the European Commission is wary of encouraging Gypsies to present themselves as a nation. The might, it is feared, open a Pandora’s box already containing Basques, Corsicans and other awkward peoples. Besides, acknowledging Gypsies as a nation might backfire, just when several countries, particularly Hungary, Slovakia and the Czech Republic, are beginning to treat them better, in order to qualify for EU membership. “The EU’s whole premise is to overcome differences, not to highlight them,” says a nervous Eurocrat.
But the idea that the Gypsies should win some kind of special recognition as Europe’s largest continent wide minority, and one with a terrible history of persecution, is catching on . Gypsies have suffered many pogroms over the centuries. In Romania, the country that still has the largest number of them (more than 1m), in the 19th century they were actually enslaved. Hitler tried to wipe them out, along with the Jews.
“Gypsies deserve some space within European structures,” says Jan Marinus Wiersma, a Dutchman in the European Parliament who suggests that one of the current commissioners should be responsible for Gypsy affairs. Some prominent Gypsies say they should be more directly represented, perhaps with a quota in the European Parliament. That, they argue, might give them a boost. There are moves afoot to help them to get money for, among other things, a Gypsy university.
One big snag is that Europe’s Gypsies are, in fact, extremely heterogeneous. They belong to many different, and often antagonistic, clans and tribes, with no common language or religion, Their self-proclaimed leaders have often proved quarrelsome and corrupt. Still, says, Dimitrina Petrova, head of the European Roma Rights Center in Budapest, Gypsies’ shared experience of suffering entitles them to talk of one nation; their potential unity, she says, stems from “being regarded as sub-human by most majorities in Europe.”
And they have begun to be a bit more pragmatic. In Slovakia and Bulgaria, for instance, Gypsy political parties are trying to form electoral blocks that could win seats in parliament. In Macedonia, a Gypsy party already has some—and even runs a municipality. Nicholas Gheorge, an expert on Gypsy affairs at the OSCE, reckons that, spread over Central Europe, there are now about 20 Gypsy MPS and mayors, 400-odd local councilors, and a growing number of businessmen and intellectuals.
That is far from saying that they have the people or the cash to forge a nation. But, with the Gypsy question on the EU’s agenda in Central Europe, they are making ground.

The Best Title of this passage is
[A]. Gypsies Want to Form a Nation.         [B]. Are They a Nation.
[C]. EU Is Afraid of Their Growth.           [C]. They Are a Tribe

寫作手法與文章大意
   文章以對比手法環繞吉普塞是不是一個民族/國家，可不可以取得合法地位這一中心而寫。從人口上說，它的數量超過加入歐盟許多國家，應在歐盟中一席之底。但人口分散在各國，他是對抗的部落，還沒有共同的語言和信仰。不像猶太人，它們沒有回歸的祖居地。它們成立了國際聯盟，也選出了領導，在布魯塞爾開設了辦事處，想成立國會，但不知如何落實操作，只是極力遊說歐盟和聯合國等組織，以獲得一個合法地位和發言權。這是歐盟日程表上一個問題，但歐盟等機構又擔心，萬一他們取得正式地位，那些國家中正鬧分離和獨立的民族也會提出同樣的要求，就象潘朵拉盒子那樣，不能打開。

答案祥解
B. 他們是一個民族/國家嗎？整篇文章環境這一點而寫，文章一開始就提出中歐入歐盟的國家會給大陸吉普塞人一個機會，承認他們是一個民族——國家，雖然沒有界定的領土（作為國家，應有領土）。吉普塞人的領袖人物也指出其人數超過歐盟中許多現在有的和將來要入盟的國家。他們至少要在歐盟中有一席之地。第二段提出，吉普塞和猶太人不同，他們沒有可回歸的祖居地。他們的語言屬印歐語系。英國人認為他們來自埃及及移民。最可能的是七世紀時一些流浪的手工業工人和藝人從印度向西方流移。第三段涉及一種思想——以吉普塞文化為基礎的無疆土的吉普塞民族應有個說話的地方—越來越為人接受。國際吉普塞人聯盟聲稱代表30多個國家的吉普塞人，做了幾件事：展開自我聯合，提出語言標準和書面形式，在聯合國進行遊說活動時揮動吉普塞國旗，在布魯塞爾設立辦事處，六月在捷克首都布拉格召開會議。第四段集中講到會上選出了聯盟主席。一群選出吉普塞的政治家——國會議員，市長，地方政務委員再次在布拉格開會，會議由歐洲安全合作條約組織召集，來討論如何動員更多的吉普塞人參政。第五段涉及聯盟雄心勃勃的宣佈要建立國會，但如何實際操作還未落實。後面主要是外界對吉普塞的態度。第六段描述歐盟委員會在吉普塞作為最大的大陸少數民族，歷史上遭到殘酷的迫害，應贏得特別承認。19世紀他們橫遭奴役，希特勒企圖把它們和猶太人一起消滅。第八段講了歐洲會議中有人提出吉普塞在歐洲機構中應有一席之地，還提議一個常務委員負責吉普塞事務。還有行動籌建建立一所吉普塞大學。後面兩段講的是困難，第九段點出。最後一段指出，現在說他們有人有錢可以組成（國家）為時還早，可是吉普塞是歐盟中日程表上的一個問題，他們日益接近解決。從內部，外部情況分析都說明吉普塞是一個組成國家的民族。全文都是環繞它是不是，該不該承認為民族/國家而寫，所以B項他們是不是民族是最佳標題。
A. 吉普塞要想組成一個國家（民族）。這只是文章涉及到的部分內容，中歐國家想加入歐盟一事可能產生的結果。      C. 歐盟害怕它們成長。      D. 他們是一個部落。
A. 最可能是在7世紀從印度流浪到西方。見第1題第二注釋。
B. 他們分散在世界各地。        C. 可能他們源於中歐。      D. 他們可能來自國際吉普塞人聯盟。
D. 它們在這些國際組織，如歐盟，聯合國中進行活動遊說要取得一席之地。見第1題第一段，三段注釋。
A. 它們遊說活動歐盟和聯合國接受他們的要求。太抽象。       B. 它們活動遊說在國際機構取得職位。           C. 他們遊說作為民族的權利。
C. 它害怕巴斯克人，科西嘉人和其他要求分裂的民族會提出同樣的要求。見難句譯注11。

                 Passage Three (Method of Scientific Inquiry)
Why the inductive and mathematical sciences, after their first rapid development at the culmination of Greek civilization, advanced so slowly for two thousand years—and why in the following two hundred years a knowledge of natural and mathematical science has accumulated, which so vastly exceeds all that was previously known that these sciences may be justly regarded as the products of our own times—are questions which have interested the modern philosopher not less than the objects with which these sciences are more immediately conversant. Was it the employment of a new method of research, or in the exercise of greater virtue in the use of the old methods, that this singular modern phenomenon had its origin? Was the long period one of arrested development, and is the modern era one of normal growth? Or should we ascribe the characteristics of both periods to so-called historical accidents—to the influence of conjunctions in circumstances of which no explanation is possible, save in the omnipotence and wisdom of a guiding Providence?
The explanation which has become commonplace, that the ancients employed deduction chiefly in their scientific inquiries, while the moderns employ induction, proves to be too narrow, and fails upon close examination to point with sufficient distinctness the contrast that is evident between ancient and modern scientific doctrines and inquiries. For all knowledge is founded on observation, and proceeds from this by analysis, by synthesis and analysis, by induction and deduction, and if possible by verification, or by new appeals to observation under the guidance of deduction—by steps which are indeed correlative parts of one method; and the ancient sciences afford examples of every one of these methods, or parts of one method, which have been generalized from the examples of science.
A failure to employ or to employ adequately any one of these partial methods, an imperfection in the arts and resources of observation and experiment, carelessness in observation, neglect of relevant facts, by appeal to experiment and observation—these are the faults which cause all failures to ascertain truth, whether among the ancients or the moderns; but this statement does not explain why the modern is possessed of a greater virtue, and by what means he attained his superiority. Much less does it explain the sudden growth of science in recent times.
The attempt to discover the explanation of this phenomenon in the antithesis of “facts” and “theories” or “facts” and “ideas”—in the neglect among the ancients of the former, and their too exclusive attention to the latter—proves also to be too narrow, as well as open to the charge of vagueness. For in the first place, the antithesis is not complete. Facts and theories are not coordinate species. Theories, if true, are facts—a particular class of facts indeed, generally complex, and if a logical connection subsists between their constituents, have all the positive attributes of theories.
Nevertheless, this distinction, however inadequate it may be to explain the source of true method in science, is well founded, and connotes an important character in true method. A fact is a proposition of simple. A theory, on the other hand, if true has all the characteristics of a fact, except that its verification is possible only by indirect, remote, and difficult means. To convert theories into facts is to add simple verification, and the theory thus acquires the full characteristics of a fact.

The title that best expresses the ideas of this passage is
[A]. Philosophy of mathematics.              [B]. The Recent Growth in Science.
[C]. The Verification of Facts.                [C]. Methods of Scientific Inquiry.
According to the author, one possible reason for the growth of science during the days of the ancient Greeks and in modern times is
[A]. the similarity between the two periods.
[B]. that it was an act of God.
[C]. that both tried to develop the inductive method.
[D]. due to the decline of the deductive method.
The difference between “fact” and “theory”
[A]. is that the latter needs confirmation.
[B]. rests on the simplicity of the former.
[C]. is the difference between the modern scientists and the ancient Greeks.
[D]. helps us to understand the deductive method.
According to the author, mathematics is
[A]. an inductive science.           [B]. in need of simple verification.
[C]. a deductive science.            [D]. based on fact and theory.
The statement “Theories are facts” may be called.
[A]. a metaphor.                  [B]. a paradox.
[C]. an appraisal of the inductive and deductive methods.
[D]. a pun.

[結構簡析] 破折號後面的內容（見難句譯注2）先撇開。這樣便於理解，整個句子是主謂表結構，前面一個問題句作主語，question後跟一個定語從句，和not less than連接的表語。
[參考譯文] 為什麼歸納發和數學科學，在希臘文明達到頂點時首先快速發展後，兩千年內進展緩慢，現在哲學家對這個問題的興趣不亞於對這些科學很熟悉研究的物件。

Or should we ascribe the characteristics of both periods to so-called historical accidents—to the influence of conjunctions in circumstances of which no explanation is possible, save in the omnipotence and wisdom of a guiding Providence?
[參考譯文] 或者我們是否應當把兩個階段的特點歸因於所謂的歷史的偶然性（意外事件）——歸因於客觀環境中相似（結合）的影響。這一點除非以指導一切的上帝的智慧和無限權利來解釋，否則難以解說清楚。

寫作方法與文章大意
這是篇議論文，論及科學探索的方法，總體是因果寫法，具體分析又是對比寫法。作者採用問答方式探究為什麼希臘文明頂峰之後兩千年，科技發展緩慢，而最近兩百年又迅速發展超越前人，其原因在哪里？是採用新，舊方法所致，歷史之偶然性，還是上天安排。
然後以現代用歸納法，古代用演繹法太狹隘說明科學總是在觀察，實驗，檢驗，證實中前進。但事實難以解釋慢和快的現象。最後以“對立”——事實和理論對立古代重視事實來解釋。然這兩者是對立的統一。真正的理論就是事實。事實，構成之間具邏輯聯繫，就具有理論的一切正面特性。這種區分雖不足以解釋科學研究中真正方法，但奠定了良好的基礎，含有真正方法中的重要特性。

答案祥解
D. 科學研究/探索的方法。文章一開始就提出問題，為什麼從希臘文化頂峰時期後兩千年來歸納法和數學科學發展如此緩慢，而後的兩百年又超越了前人，是應用新，舊方法關係還是其他（見難句譯注1，2）。第二段講埃及古代在科學探索中運用了演繹推理法，而現在應用了歸納法。這種解釋太狹隘，經仔細審核，難以很清晰地點明古代和現代科學教義和探究上明顯的差別。因為一切知識都基於觀察，通過分析，綜合，或綜合分析，歸納演繹推理，有可能的話，經過校正或經由演繹指導下再觀察而向前推進。第三段進一步闡明不用這些方法觀察，實驗；忽略相關事實，推理不慎；不能答出理論的結論，再用實驗或觀察來檢驗等或用得不全，不論在古代還是現代都會失敗。但這不能說明為什麼現代科學具有較高的功效，通過什麼方式方法，超越了前人，更不用說說明最近科學突飛猛進的原因。第四，五段涉及事實和理論的關係。
A. 數學的哲學，文內沒有提。        B. 近來科學的發展。       C. 事實的驗證，只是最後兩段提及驗證方法之作用。
B. 是上天的安排，這是作家在用方法論等失敗後得出的結論。見難句譯注4，第一段最後一句話。
A. 兩個階段的相似性。      . 兩者都試圖應用歸納法。      D. 由於演繹法的衰落。
A. 後者需要證實。答案在第四，五段，死段試圖在事實的對立面和理論，或事實和思想中發現上述現象的解釋看起來有餓太狹隘，也會因模糊不清遭批評。因為，對立面不全面，事實和理論不是同類的事物。理論，如果是真正的理論，就是事實——一種特殊類別的事實，一般複雜，但仍是事實。而事實，從詞的狹義來說，如果很複雜，如果各成分中存在著邏輯的聯繫，就具有理論的一切主要特徵。第五段第二句，事實是一個提議，通過運用知識的源泉和經驗而證實的提議直接而又簡單。而理論，若是真理論，就有事實的一切特性（除非其證實只能通過非直接的，遙遠的和困難的方式方法），把理論轉成事實必須用簡單的核實，理論因此具有事實的一切特性。
B. 前者簡單。         C. 是現代科學家和古希臘的差異。         D. 幫助我們瞭解演繹法，三項都不對。
C. 是推理演繹科學，這個問題常識就能回答。
A. 歸納法科學。        B. 需要簡單證實。           D. 基於事實和理論。
B. 是一個悖論，見第四，五段注釋。
A. 比喻。      C. 對歸納法和演繹法的讚揚。        D. 雙關語。

                   Passage Four (It Is Bush)
On the 36th day after they had voted, Americans finally learned Wednesday who would be their next president: Governor George W. Bush of Texas.
Vice President Al Gore, his last realistic avenue for legal challenge closed by a U. S. Supreme Court decision late Tuesday, planned to end the contest formally in a televised evening speech of perhaps 10 minutes, advisers said.
They said that Senator Joseph Lieberman, his vice presidential running mate, would first make brief comments. The men would speak from a ceremonial chamber of the Old Executive office Building, to the west of the White House.
The dozens of political workers and lawyers who had helped lead Mr. Gore’s unprecedented fight to claw a come-from-behind electoral victory in the pivotal state of Florida were thanked Wednesday and asked to stand down.
“The vice president has directed the recount committee to suspend activities,” William Daley, the Gore campaign chairman, said in a written statement.
Mr. Gore authorized that statement after meeting with his wife, Tipper, and with top advisers including Mr. Daley.
He was expected to telephone Mr. Bush during the day. The Bush campaign kept a low profile and moved gingerly, as if to leave space for Mr. Gore to contemplate his next steps.
Yet, at the end of a trying and tumultuous process that had focused world attention on sleepless vote counters across Florida, and on courtrooms form Miami to Tallahassee to Atlanta to Washington the Texas governor was set to become the 43d U. S. president.
The news of Mr. Gore’s plans followed the longest and most rancorous dispute over a U. S. presidential election in more than a century, one certain to leave scars in a badly divided country.
It was a bitter ending for Mr. Gore, who had outpolled Mr. Bush nationwide by some 300000 votes, but, without Florida, fell short in the Electoral College by 271votes to 267—the narrowest Electoral College victory since the turbulent election of 1876.
Mr. Gore was said to be distressed by what he and many Democratic activists felt was a partisan decision from the nation’s highest court.
The 5-to –4 decision of the Supreme Court held, in essence, that while a vote recount in Florida could be conducted in legal and constitutional fashion, as Mr. Gore had sought, this could not be done by the Dec. 12 deadline for states to select their presidential electors.
James Baker 3rd, the former secretary of state who represented Mr. Bush in the Florida dispute, issued a short statement after the U. S. high court ruling, saying that the governor was “very pleased and gratified.”
Mr. Bush was planning a nationwide speech aimed at trying to begin to heal the country’s deep, aching and varied divisions. He then was expected to meet with congressional leaders, including Democrats. Dick Cheney, Mr. Bush’s ruing mate, was meeting with congressmen Wednesday in Washington.
When Mr. Bush, who is 54, is sworn into office on Jan.20, he will be only the second son of  a president to follow his father to the White House, after John Adams and John Quincy Adams in the early 19th century.
Mr. Gore, in his speech, was expected to thank his supporters, defend his hive-week battle as an effort to ensure, as a matter of principle, that every vote be counted, and call for the nation to join behind the new president. He was described by an aide as “resolved and resigned.”
While some constitutional experts had said they believed states could present electors as late as Dec. 18, the U. S. high court made clear that it saw no such leeway.
The U.S. high court sent back “for revision” to the Florida court its order allowing recounts but made clear that for all practical purposes the election was over.
In its unsigned main opinion, the court declared, “The recount process, in its features here described, is inconsistent with the minimum procedures necessary to protect the fundamental right of each voter.”
That decision, by a court fractured along philosophical lines, left one liberal justice charging that the high court’s proceedings bore a political taint.
Justice John Paul Stevens wrote in an angry dissent:” Although we may never know with complete certainty the identity of the winner of this year’s presidential election, the identity of the loser is perfectly clear. It is the nation’s confidence in the judge as an impartial guardian of the law.”
But at the end of five seemingly endless weeks, during which the physical, legal and constitutional machines of the U. S. election were pressed and sorely tested in ways unseen in more than a century, the system finally produced a result, and one most Americans appeared to be willing at lease provisionally to support.
The Bush team welcomed the news with an outward show of restraint and aplomb. The governor’s hopes had risen and fallen so many times since Election night, and the legal warriors of each side suffered through so many dramatic reversals, that there was little energy left for celebration.

The main idea of this passage is
[A]. Bush’s victory in presidential election bore a political taint.

[A]. the American president is decided by the supreme court’s decision.
[B]. people can’t directly elect their president.
[C]. the American president is elected by a slate of presidential electors.
[D]. the people of each state support Mr. Bush.
What was the result of the 5—4 decision of the supreme court?
[A]. It was in fact for the vote recount.
[B]. It had nothing to do with the presidential election.
[C]. It decided the fate of the winner.
[D]. It was in essence against the vote recount.

It was a bitter ending for Mr. Gore, who had outpolled Mr. Bush nationwide by some 300000 votes, but, without Florida, fell short in the Electoral College by 271votes to 267—the narrowest Electoral College victory since the turbulent election of 1876.
[結構簡析] outpoll 得到的選票超過某人。Fall short (of) 缺少，不足，達不到。Electoral college 選舉團票，指每一個州人民選出一群人組成選舉團，由它們直接選舉總統。
The election of 1876
這是指1876年11月7日美國內戰時少將，共和黨人，俄亥俄州州長盧瑟福·海因斯，在總統選舉結束後，認為自己輸給民主黨人，紐約州長薩繆爾·賴爾登而安息。可在第二天，因為涉嫌欺騙行為，有爭議之州，如佛羅里達，路易士安娜，南卡羅萊納重新計票及訴訟。那一年選舉結果爭議持續了四個月的時間。國會因爭議，不得不推遲總統就職時間。到第二年，1877年3月4日，總統就職最後期限的前兩天，國會建立了一個兩党聯合選舉委員會：包括八名共和黨人和七名民主黨人。最後該會把所有爭議的選舉人票都給了海因斯。結果以185票對賴爾登184張選舉團票。海因斯多一票當選為美國第19任總統。2000年的美國總統選舉與1876年的很相似。所以句內提及。
7.  James Baker 3rd     貝克曾任前共和黨總統雷根（Ronald Reagen）政府的內閣成員和白宮辦公所主任。在小布希父親的父親George Bush任總統時又擔任過國務卿（1989——1993）。這次他是小布希為重新計票問題在法庭展開鬥爭的律師代表，而民主黨的律師代表似乎克林頓政府中擔任過國務卿的克里斯多夫Warren Christopher (1993--1997)。
8.  Dick Cheney        切尼是小布希父親執政時的老臣。他這次出山要以輔弼大臣的資格和經驗輔佐朝政。所以報導中提到he will act in the Bush administration as a president in a corporation while George W. Bush as the Chairman of the board of directors.
John Adams (1735—1848), 約翰·亞當斯，美國第二任總統（1979——1801），聯邦黨人，Federalist, 是起草獨立宣言的關鍵人物。
John Quincy Adams （1767—1848） 美國第六任總統，是上述亞當斯大兒子。
resolved and resigned 這裏指他的追隨者認為戈爾堅定而又順從（天命），因為戈爾的演說，一方面感謝他們的支持，五星期來保證每張票都應計算的努力是捍衛了原則問題，另一方面也是號召全國支持新總統。
It saw no such leeway.  美國高等法院認為這是沒有成功的多花時間，金錢的事。和後面句內for all practical purpose the election was over 事實上選舉已結束（已成定居），傳達了高等法院認為重新計票毫無作用之義。
That decision, by a court fractured along philosophical lines, left one liberal justice charging that the high court’s proceedings bore a political taint.
[參考譯文] 法院這一裁決割裂了哲學思想，使一位自由派法官（司法官）指高等法院程式沾上了政治污點。
But at the end of five seemingly endless weeks, during which the physical, legal and constitutional machines of the U. S. election were pressed and sorely tested in ways unseen in more than a century, the system finally produced a result, and one most Americans appeared to be willing at lease provisionally to support.
[參考譯文] 經過5個似乎無休止的星期之後，這個制度總算產生了一個結果，一個大多數美國人，至少目前能暫時支持的總統。在這五星期內，有形的，法律的，政體的機器都經受了壓力（都很緊張），也經受了一百多年來沒有見過的這方面的沉重考驗。

寫作方法和文章大意
這是一篇報導，其特點先畫龍點睛指出中心事實，Bush當選，戈爾退出，然後以對比手法寫出勝者和敗方的處理方法，前者低調，謹慎，似乎寬容，後者似乎退讓，認命，再次選舉的經過，特別是最高法院的裁決，決定選舉的命運點出勝敗之因（因果寫法）。小布希的險勝有點類似1876的選舉（實例佐證）。

答案祥解
A. 布希在總統選舉中獲勝沾上了政治污點。整篇文章環繞這一點而寫。文章一開始就寫戈爾在高等法院裁決下退出競選，再寫布希得勝後的低調行動表示對戈爾的期望。仁厚點出271——276選舉團票布希的險勝是和全國最高法院的欺詐性裁決有關，這令戈爾痛心疾首，令布希等感恩戴德。最後集中寫了高等法院司法程式沾上了政治污點，以及當選之布希的後果——大多數美國人似乎暫時會支持。這一切說明布希勝勝不武，而戈爾卻是雖敗尤勝。
B. 美國總統選舉過程，文章過程的焦點在布希獲勝之因，不單單是過程，故B. 項不對。
C. 高等法院在總統選舉中起著重要的作用。其作用是欺詐性裁決，偏袒布希獲勝，是政治污點，反映了布希的手段。      D. 戈爾很難受，這是事實，但不是中心思想。
B. 布希希望戈爾（能退一步）承認失敗，並支持他，而戈爾確實是也這樣做了。所以他的助手稱戈爾為“resolved and resigned.” 堅決而又順從天命的人。至少在他的演講中號召人們追隨新總統。
A. 布希希望戈爾參與他的政府。      C. 布希希望戈爾祝賀他。     D. 布希希望戈爾繼續和他鬥下去。
C. 美國的總統由選舉團提名選舉產生。見難句譯注5和6。
A. 美國總統由高等法院裁決。        B. 人民不能直接選舉總統。這只是第一步的原因，主要原因在C.        D. 各州人民支持布希。
D. 其結果實質上就是反對重新計票。這在第十二段闡述得很清楚：高等法院5比4之裁決實質上就是重新計票在12月12日州選舉總統選舉團的最後一天之前是不能進行的，而戈爾曾認為弗羅裏達州可以法律和憲法的形式重新計票。總統選舉團一產生。總統由選舉團提名選舉產生，那麼重新計票與否對總統選舉實際上是毫無作用，所以說5比4裁決12月12日之前……實質上就是反對重新計票。
A. 其結果實際上是支持重新計票。不對。        B. 其結果和總統選舉毫無關係，不對，關係很大，見D項注釋。        C. 其結果決定勝者的命運。
B. 它隱射2000年的總統選舉和1876年的總統選舉兩者之間有著很大的相似之處。見難句譯注6，海因斯認為輸了，正準備放棄，誰知涉嫌欺騙行為，對有爭議的州進行重新計票。結果是海因斯以一票之差險勝。重新計票以及險勝都和2000年總統選舉相似，其他方面，如以為輸而沒有輸，重新計票州多而且起到作用等……，都和2000年選舉不同，所以只能選B項，A項完全一樣是錯誤的。
A. 兩者選舉總統過程一個樣。       C. 把1876年總統選舉比作2000年的總統選舉。      D. 作為例子給出。 這裏沒有說明。
           Passage Five (Women’s Positions in the 17th Century)
Social circumstances in Early Modern England mostly served to repress women’s voices. Patriarchal culture and institutions constructed them as chaste, silent, obedient, and subordinate. At the beginning of the 17th century, the ideology of patriarchy, political absolutism, and gender hierarchy were reaffirmed powerfully by King James in The Trew Law of Free Monarchie and the Basilikon Doron; by that ideology the absolute power of God the supreme patriarch was seen to be imaged in the absolute monarch of the state and in the husband and father of a family. Accordingly, a woman’s subjection, first to her father and then to her husband, imaged the subjection of English people to their monarch, and of all Christians to God. Also, the period saw an outpouring of repressive or overtly misogynist sermons, tracts, and plays, detailing women’s physical and mental defects, spiritual evils, rebelliousness, shrewish ness, and natural inferiority to men.
Yet some social and cultural conditions served to empower women. During the Elizabethan era (1558—1603) the culture was dominated by a powerful Queen, who provided an impressive female example though she left scant cultural space for other women. Elizabethan women writers began to produce original texts but were occupied chiefly with translation. In the 17th century, however, various circumstances enabled women to write original texts in some numbers. For one thing, some counterweight to patriarchy was provided by female communities—mothers and daughters, extended kinship networks, close female friends, the separate court of Queen Anne (King James’ consort) and her often oppositional masques and political activities. For another, most of these women had a reasonably good education (modern languages, history, literature, religion, music, occasionally Latin) and some apparently found in romances and histories more expansive terms for imagining women’s lives. Also, representation of vigorous and rebellious female characters in literature and especially on the stage no doubt helped to undermine any monolithic social construct of women’s mature and role.
Most important, perhaps, was the radical potential inherent in the Protestant insistence on every Christian’s immediate relationship with God and primary responsibility to follow his or her individual conscience. There is plenty of support in St Paul’s epistles and elsewhere in the Bible for patriarchy and a wife’s subjection to her husband, but some texts (notably Galatians 3:28) inscribe a very different politics, promoting women’s spiritual equality: “There is neither Jew nor Greek, there is neither bond nor free, there is neither male nor female: for ye are all one in Jesus Christ.” Such texts encouraged some women to claim the support of God the supreme patriarch against the various earthly patriarchs who claimed to stand toward them in his stead.
There is also the gap or slippage between ideology and common experience. English women throughout the 17th century exercised a good deal of accrual power: as managers of estates in their husbands’ absences at court or on military and diplomatic missions; as members of guilds; as wives and mothers who apex during the English Civil War and Interregnum (1640-60) as the execution of the King and the attendant disruption of social hierarchies led many women to seize new roles—as preachers, as prophetesses, as deputies for exiled royalist husbands, as writers of religious and political tracts.

寫作方法與文章大意
   文章論述了17世紀英國婦女的地位，採用對比寫作手法。一方面（第一段）英皇詹姆士重新以法律形式確定：家長制的思想體系，政治上集權主義，性別等級制。而思想意識是上帝的絕對權威；最高等級制體現在絕對君主政權上，體現在家庭的父親和丈夫身上。所以婦女先對父親，後對丈夫的服從體現了英國臣民對君權，全體基督徒對上帝的服從。那時代造就的婦女都是貞潔，沈默，服從，低下。
另方面，某些社會和文化因素賦予婦女以力量，首先是女皇伊莉莎白統治的時期，她本身就是一個強有力的榜樣。其次一些婦女親情關係，以及安娜女皇的分庭抗禮統治活動和舞會。再則是大多數活動婦女都受過良好教育。最重要的是有些聖經文本鼓吹婦女精神平等。
最後一段論述了英國婦女實際上有的已經掌握實權，如丈夫公務，他們管理莊園田產。

答案祥解
A. 17世紀英國婦女地位。見上面文章大意。
B. 婦女服從于家族制。        D. 17世紀婦女的反抗，都是A.內容中的一部分，不能作為最佳標題。      C. 17世紀英國社會形式，只能作為背景出現。
C. 她沒有做什麼。英女皇伊莉莎白在位時期間在文化上並沒有婦女做過什麼。這在第二段講得很清楚。“伊莉莎白統治時期（1558——1603），文化領域為強有裏女皇所控制，她本人確實樹立了令人難忘的婦女形象，可是她並沒有為其他婦女能夠創作一些東西。”見前面列出之原因和下一道題的A. B. C.
D. 伊莉莎白女皇的政治活動。這文內沒有提及。
A. 婦女親情網對家長制進行抗衡。      B. 安娜女皇的政治活動。        C. 大多數婦女都受過良好教育。這三項在第二段中都提到。“首先，婦女親情關係，如母親，女兒，他們的親戚網，好友；安娜女皇單獨的宮殿，她那對立的化裝舞會和政治活動都和族長制予以抗衡。”
B. 除了某些文本外，它也要求婦女服從。第一段，見上述內容。第三段集中論述這一點。“也許，最重要的是基督教固有潛在激進性。它堅持主張每個基督徒和上帝的直接關係，堅持人首先責任是服從她或他的良知。在聖·保羅使徒書以及在別的聖經中有許多對家長制，妻子對丈夫的服從支持。可是有些文本鐫刻著一種完全不同的政治觀點，鼓吹婦女精神平等：”人沒有猶太和希臘之分，沒有束縛或自由之分，沒有男女之分，因為在耶酥基督面前，你們都是一樣。“
A. 它什麼也沒有做。不對。         C. 它支持婦女。也不對，只有某些版本支持。     D. 它求助於上帝。它借上帝之名壓制婦女。第一段：“因此，婦女首先服從父親，然後服從丈夫，體現了（象徵）英國人民服從他們的君主，所有基督徒服從上帝。”

Passage Six (The Present Is the Most Important) Shams and delusions are esteemed for soundest truths, while reality is fabulous. If men would steadily observe realities only, and not allow themselves to be deluded, life, to compare it with such things as we know, would be like a fairy tale and the Arabian Nights’ Entertainments. If we respected only what is inevitable and has a right to be , music and poetry would resound along the streets. When we are unhurried and wise, we perceive that only great and worthy things have any permanent and absolute existence, --that petty fears and petty pleasure are but the shadow of reality. This is always exhilarating and sublime. By closing the eyes and slumbering, by consenting to be deceived by shows, men establish and confirm their daily life of routine and habit everywhere, which still is built on purely illusory foundation. Children, who play life, discern its true law and relations more clearly than men, who fail to live worthily, but who think that they are wiser by experience, that is, by failure. I have read in a Hindoo book, that “there was a king’s son, who, being expelled in infancy from his native city, was brought up by a forester, and, growing up to maturity in that state, imagined himself to belong to the barbarous race with which be lived. One of his father’s ministers having discovered him, revealed to him what he was, and the misconception of his character was removed, and he knew himself to be a prince. So soul, from the circumstances in which it is placed, mistakes its own character, until the truth is revealed to it by some holy teacher, and then it knows itself to be Brahme.” We think that that is which appears to be. If a man should give us an account of the realities he beheld, we should not recognize the place in his description. Look at a meeting-house, or a court-house, or a jail, or a shop. Or a dwelling-house, and say what that thing really is before a true gaze, and they would all go to pieces in your account of them. Men esteem truth remote, in the outskirts of the system, behind the farthest star, before Adam and after the last man. In eternity there is indeed something true and sublime. But all these times and places and occasions are now and here. God himself culminates in the present moment, and will never be more divine in the lapse of all ages. And we are enabled to apprehend at all what is sublime and noble only by the perpetual instilling and drenching of the reality that surrounds us. The universe constantly and obediently answers to our conceptions; whether we travel fast or slow, the track is laid for us. Let us spend our lives in conceiving then. The poet or the artist never yet had as fair and noble a design but some of his posterity at least could accomplish it.

寫作方法與文章大意 這是一篇從哲學角度探討人應重視現實的論說文。採用以對比，具體實例說明的寫作手法。先用虛偽和欺騙被尊為至高無上的真理一事，跟正視現實，尊重必然的東西對比，引出後者是美好生活的來源。再以大人和孩子對比，孩子更能分辨生活的規律。最後從過去，未來和現在對比，人們對過去認為就是這麼一回事，崇拜遙遠的一切。作者提醒人們——此時此地的現實是最重要的。
答案祥解 1. A. 欽佩。本文第三句“如果我們只尊重必然的東西，尊重有權威為必然的東西，那麼音樂和詩歌會重新在街上唱誦。”本文最後一句“雖然詩人或藝術從來沒有如此美好和崇高的設想，但他們有些後代至少會達到這一步的。”還有難句譯注1。這些都說明作者對藝術視為崇高和美好，不是被蒙蔽的東西。 B. 漠不關心。 C. 懷疑的。 D. 排斥。多不對。 2. B. 孩子們常常比成人更好地棉隊各種問題。本文第七句“孩子們遊戲生活（整天只知道玩兒），卻比難以很好的生活的成人們更清楚的分辨出顯示生活的真正規律和種種關係。” A. 孩子應當實踐印度佈道宣傳的東西。 C. 幾乎對其真實出身一無所知。這是講王子的事情，不是一般孩子。 D. 難以欣賞藝術。並未提及。 3. B. 珍視目前的真正價值。這在文章倒數第五句“永恆中，確實有真實和崇高的東西存在。但是所有這一切時間，地點，機遇都是在此時此地。上帝本身在現時達到了頂峰。在今後流逝的歲月中，它絕不會更加神聖崇高。我們只有長期不斷地灌輸和浸潤在周圍現實之中，才能理解什麼是崇高和神聖的東西。不論我們的步伐快還是慢，路線已為我鋪定。那就讓我們的生命在體會感受中度過。”作者強調現實才是人們應該抓住的。 A. 指望未來給予啟迪。 C. 尊重過去的智慧。 D. 在悠閒的活動中花更多的時間。 4. D. 神學和哲學。整篇文章都傳遞了這兩個內容，特別是哲學推理論說。 A. 歷史和經濟學。 B. 社會和人口。 C. 生物和物理。
Passage Seven (Forecasting of Statistics) Nearly two thousand years have passed since a census decreed by Caesar Augustus become part of the greatest story ever told. Many things have changed in the intervening years. The hotel industry worries more about overbuilding than overcrowding, and if they had to meet an unexpected influx, few inns would have a manager to accommodate the weary guests. Now it is the census taker that does the traveling in the fond hope that a highly mobile population will stay long enough to get a good sampling. Methods of gathering, recording, and evaluating information have presumably been improved a great deal. And where then it was the modest purpose of Rome to obtain a simple head count as an adequate basis for levying taxes, now batteries of complicated statistical series furnished by governmental agencies and private organizations are eagerly scanned and interpreted by sages and seers to get a clue to future events. The Bible does not tell us how the Roman census takers made out, and as regards our more immediate concern, the reliability of present day economic forecasting, there are considerable differences of opinion. They were aired at the celebration of the 125th anniversary of the American Statistical Association. There was the thought that business forecasting might well be on its way from an art to a science, and some speakers talked about newfangled computers and high-falutin mathematical system in terms of excitement and endearment which we, at least in our younger years when these things mattered, would have associated more readily with the description of a fair maiden. But others pointed to the deplorable record of highly esteemed forecasts and forecasters with a batting average below that of the Mets, and the President-elect of the Association cautioned that “high powered statistical methods are usually in order where the facts are crude and inadequate, the exact contrary of what crude and inadequate statisticians assume.” We left his birthday party somewhere between hope and despair and with the conviction, not really newly acquired, that proper statistical methods applied to ascertainable facts have their merits in economic forecasting as long as neither forecaster nor public is deluded into mistaking the delineation of probabilities and trends for a prediction of certainties of mathematical exactitude.
1. Taxation in Roman days apparently was based on [A]. wealth. [B]. mobility. [C]. population. [D]. census takers. 2. The American Statistical Association [A]. is converting statistical study from an art to a science. [B]. has an excellent record in business forecasting. [C]. is neither hopeful nor pessimistic. [D]. speaks with mathematical exactitude. 3. The message the author wishes the reader to get is  [A]. statisticians have not advanced since the days of the Roman. [B]. statistics is not as yet a science. [C]. statisticians love their machine. [D].computer is hopeful. 4. The “greatest story ever told” referred to in the passage is the story of  [A]. Christmas. [B]. The Mets. [C]. Moses. [D]. Roman Census Takers.
Vocabulary 1. census 人口調查 2. decreed 分佈法令 3. influx 彙集，流入（人口或物） 4. census taker 人口調查員 5. in the intervening years 在這期間 6. sampling 取樣（調查） 7. presumable 可能的，可推測的 8. batteries 一連串，一系列 9. sage 聖人；聰明的（人—） 10. seer 先知 11. newfangled 新型的（貶義） 12. high-falutin 誇大的，誇張的 13. deplorable 悲慘的，雜亂的 14. batting average 平均成功率（原指擊球平均得分數） 15. ascertainable 可以確定的/確切的 16. delineation 描述 17. exactitude 精確

寫作方法與文章大意 文章論及“統計數字預測經濟”。採用對比論證手法，還帶點諷刺口吻，但氣勢宏偉。從兩千年前愷撒·奧古斯都下令進行的人口調查說起，講到現在的統計數位預測經濟情況。得出應當正確對待預測數字的結論。
答案祥解 1. C. 人口。答案在第六句，“那時羅馬計算人頭作為徵稅的適當基礎，目的很簡單。” A. 財富。 B. 流動性。 C. 人口調查員。 2. A. 正把統計研究從文科轉變成理科。這是從第六句開始講的一種觀點。“現在，政府機構和私人組織的一系列複雜的統計數字，由智者和先知人物殷切地流覽和解釋以取得預先外未來事件的線索。聖經並沒有告訴我們羅馬的人口調查員是怎麼調查統計的。至於我們當前更加關心的問題：目前經濟預測的可靠性，意見分歧很大。美國統計協會125周年慶祝活動上，人們在大肆宣揚這些不同觀點。有一種說法是經濟預測可能正從文科轉向科學（理科）發展。有些人興高采烈大談新型電腦和非常高級數學系統。”作者雖然沒有明說，明眼人一看便知，藝術向科學轉變正是美國統計協會在把統計學從文科轉向理科。所以A. 對。 B. 在商業預測方面具有傑出的記錄。不對。實際上“平均成功率還低於the Mets”  C. 既沒有希望也不樂觀。文內沒有提及。只提作者他們半喜半憂離開協會。  D. 以數學的精確性來說話。見下道題解釋。協會部分人卻有此看法“數學精確性。” 3. B. 統計學（到現在為止）還不是一門科學（理科）。文章最後幾句話。“連統計協會的主席也告戒說高能統計法在實際材料原始和不允許的地方一般發揮正常。這跟低級的，不合適的統計員所假定的正好相反。我們懷著憂“希”摻半的心情離開周年慶祝宴會，懷著確實不是新近才有的信念，相信應用於確切材料上恰當的統計法在經濟預測中有它的貢獻，只要預測人員和公眾不受蒙蔽，誤呆板所述概率和趨勢當作數學精確無比的預測就行。” A. 統計員從羅馬時代起就沒向前進步過。 C. 統計員愛電腦。這兩項文內沒有提到。 D. 電腦前程遠大。文內只講了有些人懷著興高采烈的心情大講新型電腦和非常高級數學“系統”，暗示了電腦大有希望。但不是所有人都這樣認為的。最重要的電腦的應用並不能改變這個事實：統計學不是立刻，而是文科。所以B. 對。 4. A. 基督，耶誕節，指基督的誕生。聖經中的一個故事。 B. the Mets. 聖經中率領希伯萊人出埃及的領袖，也作放債的猶太人講。 C. 摩西。 D. 羅馬人口調查員。
Passage Eight (Wakefield Master’s Realism) Moreover, insofar as any interpretation of its author can be made from the five or six plays attributed to him, the Wake field Master is uniformly considered to be a man of sharp contemporary observation. He was, formally, perhaps clerically educated, as his Latin and music, his Biblical and patristic lore indicate. He is, still, celebrated mainly for his quick sympathy for the oppressed and forgotten man, his sharp eye for character, a ready ear for colloquial vernacular turns of speech and a humor alternately rude and boisterous, coarse and happy. Hence despite his conscious artistry as manifest in his feeling for intricate metrical and stanza forms, he is looked upon as a kind of medieval Steinbeck, indignantly angry at, uncompromisingly and even brutally realistic in presenting the plight of the agricultural poor. Thus taking the play and the author together, it is mow fairly conventional to regard the former as a kind of ultimate point in the secularization of the medieval drama. Hence much emphasis on it as depicting realistically humble manners and pastoral life in the bleak hills of the West Riding of Yorkshire on a typically cold bight of December 24th. After what are often regarded as almost “documentaries” given in the three successive monologues of the three shepherds, critics go on to affirm that the realism is then intensified into a burlesque mock-treatment of the Nativity. Finally as a sort of epilogue or after-thought in deference to the Biblical origins of the materials, the play slides back into an atavistic mood of early innocent reverence. Actually, as we shall see, the final scene is not only the culminating scene but perhaps the raison d’etre of introductory “realism.” There is much on the surface of the present play to support the conventional view of its mood of secular realism. All the same, the “realism” of the Wakefield Master is of a paradoxical turn. His wide knowledge of people, as well as books indicates no cloistered contemplative but one in close relation to his times. Still, that life was after all a predominantly religious one, a time which never neglected the belief that man was a rebellious and sinful creature in need of redemption, So deeply (one can hardly say “naively” of so sophisticated a writer) and implicitly religious is the Master that he is less able (or less willing) to present actual history realistically than is the author of the Brome “Abraham and Isaac”. His historical sense is even less realistic than that of Chaucer who just a few years before had done for his own time costume romances, such as The Knight’s Tale, Troilus and Cressida, etc. Moreover Chaucer had the excuse of highly romantic materials for taking liberties with history.
1. Which of the following statements about the Wakefield Master is NOT True? [A]. He was Chaucer’s contemporary. [B]. He is remembered as the author of five or six realistic plays. [C]. He write like John Steinbeck. [D]. HE was an accomplished artist. 2. By “patristic”, the author means [A]. realistic. [B]. patriotic [C]. superstitious. [C]. pertaining to the Christian Fathers. 3. The statement about the “secularization of the medieval drama” refers to the [A]. introduction of mundane matters in religious plays. [B]. presentation of erudite material. [C]. use of contemporary introduction of religious themes in the early days. 4. In subsequent paragraphs, we may expect the writer of this passage to  [A]. justify his comparison with Steinbeck. [B]. present a point of view which attack the thought of the second paragraph. [C]. point out the anachronisms in the play. [D]. discuss the works of Chaucer.

寫作方法和文章大意 這是一篇文學評論，評韋克菲爾德·馬斯脫的戲劇。他是喬叟的同時代人，採用對比手法，作者對比了他和別的批評家對韋評價之差異來論證韋克菲爾德本人的觀點，立場和作品的文體，語言，內容等各個方面。然後把他跟同時代人喬叟作比較，指出他的不足。
答案祥解 1. C. 他象斯坦貝克一樣寫。第一段作者說他是一位公認的對當時代具有敏銳洞察力的作家。現在仍然享有盛名。主要在於“他對被壓迫和被遺忘的人民的同情，有著對人物性格瞭解的犀利眼光，對日常方言的曲折轉意的“耳朵”。他的幽默粗放而又喧鬧，粗魯而又愉快。因此，儘管他有意識的藝術效果（性），明顯表現在他對複雜韻律和詩節的感受力上，人們仍然尊他為中世紀的斯坦貝克，對貧苦農民悲慘命運的疾首憤怒，給以毫不妥協地甚至野性地真實描述”。這段話說明，文內兩位作家之共同點是在內容觀點上。而不是指一樣的藝術形式上。韋克菲爾德寫的是詩歌形式——韻文，而斯坦貝克是小說和散文劇。所以說他像斯坦貝克那樣寫就錯了。故選C.  A. 他是喬叟同時代人，見最後一句“他的歷史觀點的現實主義稍遜于喬叟。喬叟在幾年前就為其時代寫了一本傳奇。” B. 他是作為五或六本現實之劇本的作者而為人紀念。本文第一句話“只能從他寫的五個或六個劇本來說明這位作者。” D. 他是一位有成就的藝術家。 2. D. Patristic 義：為關於早期基督教領袖的。第一段中his Biblical and Patristic lore indicate的意思是“他那有關聖經和早期基督教領袖們的歌謠。” A. 現實主義的。 B. 愛國的。 C. 迷信的。 3. A. 在宗教劇中介紹世俗之事。見第二段中的secularization義：世俗化，脫離教會。這一整段都講了韋劇中對世俗之事的描述：“拿劇本和作者兩者一起講的話，現在習慣於把他的劇本看作中世紀戲劇世俗化的一個頂點。因此，對他世俗化強調常以一個例子來說明，即他現實主義的描述12月24日一個寒冷的夜晚，在約克郡西區荒涼的山裏的那種粗陋的習俗和鄉村的生活；在常被人認為幾乎是‘記錄文獻’的三個牧人三段連續的獨白之後，批評家們繼續認為他的現實主義在此時被強化到以諷刺嘲弄的口吻處理了基督的誕生。最後，作者收場白或事後的補充，對材料的來源聖經表示敬意。劇本又滑回到早期純潔無邪（天真）的崇敬，一種返祖基調中去。事實上最後一幕不僅是全劇的高潮，也許還是“現實主義”引言存在的理由。”這一段清楚表明。批評者認為宗教只是作者的收場白，計畫外的添加劑而已。 B. 表現淵博知識材料。 C. 應用當代材料。太籠統。當代也有宗教之事。  D. 介紹早期宗教題材。 4. B. 表達抨擊第二段思想的觀點。這個問題最難回答，其所以選擇B，是因為本人作者並不同意流行的觀點。他在講完“常規看法”有，用引導來談“紀實文獻”和“現實主義”。這說明作者之含義並不是這兩個詞的本義。這段最後一句話“事實上，最後一幕……”表明：最後一幕有宗教內容，而“現實主義”不過處於introductory階段。第三段點明作者的觀點“現在的戲劇表面上有許多支援世俗現實主義模式的觀點。韋之‘現實主義’有一個自相矛盾的特點。他對人和書本的廣泛的瞭解表明：“他不是與世隔絕，而是和時代緊密相連的。再說，那時的生活畢竟是全方位的宗教。那時代絕不會忽視這種信仰——人是叛逆和有罪的生靈，需要贖罪。大師是那麼深沉含蓄的信奉宗教，因而他比布羅姆作者更不可能（更不願）現實主義地表現真正的歷史。他的歷史感現實性甚至比喬叟更不現實主義。喬叟早在前幾年為他的時代寫了‘類似’騎士的故事”。“特羅依拉斯和克萊西德”等傳奇。再說，喬叟以高度浪漫的材料為藉口對歷史事實任意處理。”所以說，我們可以期望作者在下面一步發揮自己的觀點，抨擊第二段的看法。 A. 他和斯坦貝克的比較是公平的。 C. 指出劇中時代錯誤。 D. 討論喬叟作品。
Passage Nine (The Continuity of the Religious Struggle in Britain) Though England was on the whole prosperous and hopeful, though by comparison with her neighbors she enjoyed internal peace, she could not evade the fact that the world of which she formed a part was torn by hatred and strife as fierce as any in human history. Men were still for from recognizing that two religions could exist side by side in the same society; they believed that the toleration of another religion different from their own. And hence necessarily false, must inevitably destroy such a society and bring the souls of all its members into danger of hell. So the struggle went on with increasing fury within each nation to impose a single creed upon every subject, and within the general society of Christendom to impose it upon every nation. In England the Reformers, or Protestants, aided by the power of the Crown, had at this stage triumphed, but over Europe as a whole Rome was beginning to recover some of the ground it had lost after Martin Luther’s revolt in the earlier part of the century. It did this in two ways, by the activities of its missionaries, as in parts of Germany, or by the military might of the Catholic Powers, as in the Low Countries, where the Dutch provinces were sometimes near their last extremity under the pressure of Spanish arms. Against England, the most important of all the Protestant nations to reconquer, military might was not yet possible because the Catholic Powers were too occupied and divided: and so, in the 1570’s Rome bent her efforts, as she had done a thousand years before in the days of Saint Augustine, to win England back by means of her missionaries. These were young Englishmen who had either never given up the old faith, or having done so, had returned to it and felt called to become priests. There being, of course, no Catholic seminaries left in England, they went abroad, at first quite easily, later with difficulty and danger, to study in the English colleges at Douai or Rome: the former established for the training of ordinary or secular clergy, the other for the member of the Society of Jesus, commonly known as Jesuits, a new Order established by St, Ignatius Loyola same thirty years before. The seculars came first; they achieved a success which even the most eager could hardly have expected. Cool-minded and well-informed men, like Cecil, had long surmised that the conversion of the English people to Protestantism was for from complete; many—Cecil thought even the majority—had conformed out of fear, self-interest or—possibly the commonest reason of all—sheer bewilderment at the rapid changes in doctrine and forms of worship imposed on them in so short a time. Thus it happened that the missionaries found a welcome, not only with the families who had secretly offered them hospitality if they came, but with many others whom their first hosts invited to meet them or passed them on to. They would land at the ports in disguise, as merchants, courtiers or what not, professing some plausible business in the country, and make by devious may for their first house of refuge. There they would administer the Sacraments and preach to the house holds and to such of the neighbors as their hosts trusted and presently go on to some other locality to which they were directed or from which they received a call.

寫作方法與文章大意 這篇文章論及“羅馬教皇採用文武兩手政策在歐洲，特別在英國，恢復舊教——天主教。”採用一般到具體的寫作手法。可以說由大到小。大的歐洲背景，最後落實在英國的具體做法。重點在英國。
答案祥解 1. A. 這篇文章的中心思想是“英國宗教鬥爭以新的方式繼續進行。” B. 英國宗教的轉變。 C. 新教在英國的勝利。 D. 英國變得繁榮。這三項都是文內談到具體事情，不能作主題思想。 2. B. 新教，基督教。因為羅馬教皇推行的是天主教。這在第一段第四句明確點明：“在英國，宗教改革者，或者說基督教，在英國皇權的協助下，此時已取得勝利；而作為整個歐洲來說，羅馬教皇已經開始恢復世紀初馬丁·路德反叛後所失去的一些地盤。”馬丁·路德是改革者，也就是基督教。 A. 佛教。 C. 天主教。 D. 東正教 3. D. 宗教和武力。第一段第五句說明：“教皇用兩種辦法進行恢復，一種就像在部分德國地區進行的那樣通過傳教士的活動，另一種象在低地國裏進行的，通過天主教國家的軍事力量。那裏荷蘭的幾個省份在西班牙的軍事壓力下，常常是被逼迫得幾乎走投無路了。 A. civil and military ways文武兩手，civil範圍太廣，特別指民事的，非宗教的，文職的。這裏不合適。 B. 宣傳和抨擊。 C. 勸說和批評。都不對。 4. A. 傳教士活動在英國。第二段的開始就講到，“這些英國青年或者根本沒有放棄老的信仰，或者放棄以後又重新歸反舊教，應召成為牧師。英國當然沒有剩下天主教神學院，他們就出國，開始很容易，後來，有困難甚至有危險，到杜埃或羅馬英文學院就讀。前者專為培養一般或修道院外的牧師而建。後者是培養耶酥會教士，通稱天主耶酥會會士，是約三十年前聖·羅耀拉創建的一種神職。”在杜埃學習的牧師先回來，他們取得了令人意想不到的成功。下面就是他們（這樣指第一類修道士在英國活動情況）。“頭腦冷靜，資訊靈通人士，像西塞爾這種政治家，長期以來，一直猜度，英國人歸反基督教新教的過程遠遠沒有完成。許多人——因他們被在那麼短的時期內強加到他們身上的信仰形式，飛快變更的教義搞糊塗了。” B. 英國人歸反基督教的事情遠遠沒有完成。 C. 在英國青年開始歸反天主教。兩項選擇見上文解釋。都是傳教活動開始的原因。　　　　　　D. 大多數家庭禮待傳教士。這是第二段最後幾行談到這些傳教士秘密來到英國後的情況。他們不僅受到老關係家庭歡迎。也受到第一次邀請他們的家庭歡迎。主人還把他們介紹給其他家庭。
Passage Ten (Photography and Art) The earliest controversies about the relationship between photography and art centered on whether photograph’s fidelity to appearances and dependence on a machine allowed it to be a fine art as distinct from merely a practical art. Throughout the nineteenth century, the defence of photography was identical with the struggle to establish it as a fine art. Against the charge that photography was a soulless, mechanical copying of reality, photographers asserted that it was instead a privileged way of seeing, a revolt against commonplace vision, and no less worthy an art than painting. Ironically, now that photography is securely established as a fine art, many photographers find it pretentious or irrelevant to label it as such. Serious photographers variously claim to be finding, recording, impartially observing, witnessing events, exploring themselves—anything but making works of art. They are no longer willing to debate whether photography is or is not a fine art, except to proclaim that their own work is not involved with art. It shows the extent to which they simply take for granted the concept of art imposed by the triumph of Modernism: the better the art, the more subversive it is of the traditional aims of art. Photographers’ disclaimers of any interest in making art tell us more about the harried status of the contemporary notion of art than about whether photography is or is not art. For example, those photographers who suppose that, by taking pictures, they are getting away from the pretensions of art as exemplified by painting remind us of those Abstract Expressionist painters who imagined they were getting away from the intellectual austerity of classical Modernist painting by concentrating on the physical act of painting. Much of photography’s prestige today derives from the convergence of its aims with those of recent art, particularly with the dismissal of abstract art implicit in the phenomenon of Pop painting during the 1960’s. Appreciating photographs is a relief to sensibilities tired of the mental exertions demanded by abstract art. Classical Modernist painting—that is, abstract art as developed in different ways by Picasso, Kandinsky, and Matisse—presupposes highly developed skills of looking and a familiarity with other paintings and the history of art. Photography, like Pop painting, reassures viewers that art is not hard; photography seems to be more about its subjects than about art. Photography, however, has developed all the anxieties and self-consciousness of a classic Modernist art. Many professionals privately have begun to worry that the promotion of photography as an activity subversive of the traditional pretensions of art has gone so far that the public will forget that photography is a distinctive and exalted activity—in short, an art.
1. What is the author mainly concerned with? The author is concerned with [A]. defining the Modernist attitude toward art. [B]. explaining how photography emerged as a fine art. [C]. explaining the attitude of serious contemporary photographers toward photography as art and placing those attitudes in their historical context. [D]. defining the various approaches that serious contemporary photographers take toward their art and assessing the value of each of those approaches. 2. Which of the following adjectives best describes “the concept of art imposed by the triumph of Modernism” as the author represents it in lines 12—13? [A]. Objective [B]. Mechanical. [C]. Superficial. [D]. Paradoxical. 3. Why does the author introduce Abstract Expressionist painter? [A]. He wants to provide an example of artists who, like serious contemporary photographers, disavowed traditionally accepted aims of modern art. [B]. He wants to set forth an analogy between the Abstract Expressionist painters and classical Modernist painters. [C]. He wants to provide a contrast to Pop artist and others. [D]. He wants to provide an explanation of why serious photography, like other contemporary visual forms, is not and should not pretend to be an art. 4. How did the nineteenth-century defenders of photography stress the photography? [A]. They stressed photography was a means of making people happy. [B]. It was art for recording the world. [C]. It was a device for observing the world impartially. [D]. It was an art comparable to painting.

難句譯注 1. The earliest controversies about the relationship between photography and art centered on whether photograph’s fidelity to appearances and dependence on a machine allowed it to be a fine art as distinct from merely a practical art. [結構簡析] 此句為主謂語+賓語從句。As distinct from … 句修飾fine art. [參考譯文] 最早有關攝影和藝術關係的爭論點集中在攝影對表像的忠實和對機器的依賴能否使它成為藝術，有別於僅僅是實用的美術。 2. Against the charge that photography was a soulless, mechanical copying of reality, photographers asserted that it was instead a privileged way of seeing, a revolt against commonplace vision, and no less worthy an art than painting. [結構簡析] 結構是主謂賓從。句子長是因為介詞短語against the charge 後接同位說明語the photography was …賓語從句中有三組表語：a way of seeing, a revolt, an art. [參考譯文] 正隊這種指責：攝影是一種沒有靈魂的，對現實機械性複製，攝影工作者聲名攝影不是複製品，而是一種特殊的觀察方式，是對平庸視覺的叛逆，和繪畫一樣有藝術價值。 3. It shows the extent to which they simply take for granted the concept of art imposed by the triumph of Modernism: the better the art, the more subversive it is of the traditional aims of art. [結構簡析] 句子結構為主從句，which引導賓從作介詞to 的賓語，賓從中imposed by …分詞短語修飾concept of art, the better …the more 是說明concept of art. [參考譯文] 這說明他們就是把現代主義勝利所強加的藝術概念視為合理的，其合理程度是：藝術越強，對藝術的傳統目的破壞得越大。 4. Photographers’ disclaimers of any interest in making art tell us more about the harried status of the contemporary notion of art than about whether photography is or is not art. [結構簡析] 名詞disclaimer放棄，否認。上下文翻譯中可譯成動詞含義，否認拋棄創作藝術的興趣。 [參考譯文] 攝影師否認對創作藝術感性趣，他們告訴我們更多的是有關現代藝術概念的令人苦惱的情況，而不是攝影是不是藝術問題。 5. Many professionals privately have begun to worry that the promotion of photography as an activity subversive of the traditional pretensions of art has gone so far that the public will forget that photography is a distinctive and exalted activity—in short, an art. [結構簡析] 複合句。句內三個that clause. 第一個是worry的賓從；第二個是so far that 的句型。第三個是forget 之賓從。 [參考譯文] 許多專業攝影人員私下開始擔憂，強調攝影是對傳統藝術意圖的顛覆活動的做法有些過分了，（活動的宣傳走得太遠）以致使公眾忘記攝影是一種獨特的高尚活動——總之，是一種藝術。
寫作方法與文章大意 文章論及“攝影是否是藝術”問題，這樣採用對比手法。一開始就講述了19世紀攝影家為確立攝影是藝術而提出的種種依據，並把美術和攝影作比較，來反駁否定攝影的論點：忠於表像，以來機器，沒有靈魂…… 確立的藝術後，他們為擺脫油畫那種矯飾的藝術意圖而努力推崇“藝術越佳，對藝術傳統意圖破壞越大”的論點。作者把這些攝影家和抽象表現主義畫家相提並論，把攝影和流行畫等同；和古典現代主義畫家和畫相對抗。 最後結論是這種破壞傳統藝術意圖的活動不能走得太遠，因為攝影畢竟是藝術，否則……。
答案祥解 1. C. 說明當代嚴肅的攝影家對攝影作為藝術的態度，並把他們這些態度放在歷史的進程來觀察。見文章大意。他們先為攝影是否是藝術而爭辯，後為否定其藝術而努力。重點放在主題上。 A. 界定顯得主義者對藝術的態度。 B. 解釋攝影是如何作為美術出現的。第一段涉及，見難句譯注2。 D. 界定當代嚴肅攝影家對待他們藝術所具有的各種觀點，並評定每種觀點的價值。這三項只是文內提到的某些方面，不是主要的。 2. D. 矛盾的。見難句譯注3。 A. 客觀的。 B. 機械的。 C. 表面的。 3. A. 他要列舉這樣藝術家的例子，他們象當代嚴肅的攝影家一樣拋棄了傳統上被接受的現代藝術目的。見第三段第二句：“舉例說，這些認為通過拍照可以擺脫繪畫所表現的藝術的矯飾的攝影家，使我們想起了那些抽象表現主義繪畫的嚴肅的思想。” B. 他想在抽象表現主義畫家和古典現代主義畫家之間找出相似點。 C. 他要在流行藝術家和其他藝術家之間作一個對比。 D. 他想解釋為什麼嚴肅攝影，象其他當代視覺形式一樣不是藝術，而且也不應當充作藝術。 4. D. 攝影是一種藝術，可以和油畫相比美。見難句譯注2。  A. 他們強調攝影是使人們快樂的手段。 B. 是記錄世界的藝術。 C. 攝影是公正觀察世界的工具。
